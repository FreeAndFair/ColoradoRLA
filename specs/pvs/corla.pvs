%%% \section{Introduction}
%%%
%%% The RLA Tool is a computer system developed by Free \& Fair for
%%% the Colorado Department of State (CDOS henceforth). The RLA Tool
%%% facilitates running a risk limiting audit across several
%%% jurisdictions. In the case of Colorado, it facilitates running
%%% risk limiting audits across all counties in the state
%%% simultaneously.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Colorado Statues and Rules}
%%%
%%% The Colorado election law pertaining to election audits is
%%% \href{http://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-1/general-primary-recall-and-congressional-vacancy-elections/article-7/part-5/section-1-7-515/}
%%% {Section 1-7-515, C.R.S.}, where ``C.R.S.'' denotes ``Colorado Revised Statutes''.
%%%
%%% The rules pertaining to election audits are found in Code of
%%% Colorado Regulations, Secretary of State, State of Colorado,
%%% Department of State Elections Rules
%%% \href{http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule25.pdf}{\textbf{8
%%% CCR 1505-1}}. We will call that document \emph{Rules 1505-1} for
%%% the purpose of traceability in this specification.
%%% 
%%% The contract for this system was solicited while these rules were
%%% still under development. The final rules were adopted during week
%%% seven of the project. The initial version of these specifications
%%% was written against ``Revised Draft of Proposed Rules''
%%% (\textbf{CCR 1505-1}) dated July 6, 2017. We will call that
%%% document \emph{RDPR-6-Jul-2017} for the purpose of traceability in
%%% this specification.
%%% 
%%% Section 25, Post-Election Audit, of these documents is the salient
%%% portion of the rules for our purposes.
%%%
%%% %%% \subsection{Colorado Statues and Rules}
%%%
%%% This domain model is based upon that law, its rules, the
%%% procurement contract between CDOS and Free \& Fair, our
%%% bibliography of publications about risk-limiting audits, etc.
%%%
%%% The core of this document is a formal specification of the RLA
%%% tool.  The specification documents our thinking and the system
%%% design, from domain modeling and engineering all of the way to
%%% formal specification and verification.  In keeping with the spirit
%%% of open source development, the publication of this specification
%%% should support any interested parties with the requisite
%%% technological skills to deploy, manage maintain or evolve the
%%% system.
%%%
%%% This document is annotated to help readers who are not expert in
%%% formal system specification understand the scope and
%%% interpretations of the elements of the specification.  The prose
%%% annotations will help elections domain experts assess the
%%% completeness and correctness of the RLA tool built for Colorado.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Technical Context}
%%%
%%% The RLA Tool is a client-server system. The server is implemented
%%% in Java and runs on servers hosted by CDOS. The client is
%%% implemented in TypeScript and JavaScript and runs in modern web
%%% browsers.  CDOS provides the hosting servers, network, and a
%%% number of services in support of the tools deployment and
%%% management.
%%%
%%% This document is written in the
%%% \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming}
%%% {literate style} promoted by
%%% \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth}{Donald Knuth},
%%% using the PVS theorem prover. Writing system specifications in
%%% this fashion is called (formal) domain engineering. It allows the
%%% production of typeset books and interactive hypertext directly
%%% from the specification.  In order to write literate PVS we use our
%%% old friend Adriaan de Groot's scripts, available at
%%% \url{http://www.cs.kun.nl/~adridg/research/PVS-literate.html}. The
%%% formal domain model is written in PVS's higher-order logic (HOL).

%%% There is a corresponding informal domain model written in the Free
%%% \& Fair System Specification Language, or FAFSSL for short. FAFSSL
%%% is a daughter of Extended BON which was, in turn, a daughter of
%%% \href{BON}{http://www.bon-method.com/}, the Business Object Notation.
%%%
%%% In order to relate PVS to FAFSSL, we must define a refinement
%%% relationship between their two type systems. Informally, that
%%% mapping is described in the following paragraph.
%%%
%%% We map PVS public theories and their contents to FAFSSL
%%% constructs.  The top-level corla theory maps to the FAFSSL system
%%% specification, theories map to clusters, (PVS) types map to
%%% (FAFSSL) types, and functions map to features.
%%%
%%% The formal domain model is annotated with structured comments in
%%% precise natural language using a standard set of annotations.  A
%%% shell script processes these annotations and generates a
%%% well-typed informal FAFSSL specification.  See our Bibliography
%%% project at GitHub,
%%% \url{https://github.com/FreeAndFair/Bibliography}, for more
%%% information.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% Here is a cheat sheet for literate PVS.

%%%%%% Six percent signs (yes, %%%%%%) are meta-comments and are
%%%%%% deleted from the output in all processing modes. We typically
%%%%%% use these comments for the copyright header at the top of the
%%%%%% file and to delineate blocks of PVS code.

%%%%%% Three percent signs (%%%) are output as regular text in the
%%%%%% file mode. The text after the percent signs can contain
%%%%%% arbitrary LaTeX commands, and is output as-is. In block mode,
%%%%%% three percent sign comments are deleted from the output.

%%%%%% One percent sign (%) is output as regular text in block mode
%%%%%% and deleted in file mode.

%+BEGIN background

%%% \section{Formal Model Description}

%%% \subsection{Basic Technical Infrastructure}
%%%
%%% It is necessary to summarize a number of background concepts from
%%% computer science in order to formalize the RLA Tool.
%%
%%% The Free \& Fair System Specification Language (FAFSSL)
%%% annotations we use are as follows:
%%% \begin{description}
%%% \item[\@system] the FAFSSL name of the system
%%% \item[\@cluster] the FAFSSL name of a cluster
%%% \item[\@description] a short description of an artifact
%%% \item[\@explanation] the (potentially longer) explanation for an
%%% artifact
%%% \item[\@indexing-CLAUSE] a prefix for any indexing $<$CLAUSE$>$
%%% \end{description}
%%%
%%% These suffixes are commonly used for indexing:
%%% \begin{description}
%%% \item[author] an author of an artifact
%%% \item[organization] an organization responsible for an artifact
%%% \item[keywords] a comma-separated list of keywords
%%% \item[created] the creation date for an artifact
%%% \item[github] the URL for the GitHub project containing an artifact
%%% \end{description}
%%%
%%% \subsection{Kinds of Concepts}
%%%
%%% Three kinds of concepts, each of which is a
%%% part of speech, are introduced in any specification:
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%%
%%% \item \textbf{Nouns} are formalized by regular (composite)
%%% types. The set of types available in the prelude of PVS is large,
%%% ranging from booleans to real-world concepts like time and
%%% tokenizing leers. Composite types are product types such as tuples
%%% and records.
%%% \item \textbf{Verbs} are formalized by function types. PVS's HOL
%%% supports higher order dependent type declarations, including
%%% higher order function types. Thus, even the most complex verb
%%% forms can be formalized in the model.
%%% \item \textbf{Adjectives and adverbs} are formalized by defining
%%% function types that apply to formalizations of nouns and verbs,
%%% respectively. Often these types are either predicate types (i.e.,
%%% something is true or not), metric types encoded in enumerations or
%%% ordered structures such as numbers (i.e., how heavy something is),
%%% or are enumeration types (i.e., what properties something has, but
%%% with no particular ordering, such as the color of something).
%%% \end{itemize}
%%%
%%% Consequently, when we formalize a concept from
%%% some background informal information, we identify all domain
%%% specific nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in that source
%%% material and capture the meaning of each and every idea relevant
%%% to the system we are defining. This identification and
%%% formalization process is iterative, with the precision of the
%%% formalization generally increasing as we refine the model of the
%%% system and being defining its implementation.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Refinement from Background Literature to Specification}
%%%
%%% The Colorado \emph{statutes} (i.e., the law) pertaining to
%%% election audits is
%%% \href{http://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-1/general-primary-recall-and-congressional-vacancy-elections/article-7/part-5/section-1-7-515/}
%%% {Section 1-7-515, of the C.R.S.}. The \emph{rules} (i.e., the
%%% interpretation of the statutes and an explanation for how to
%%% realize their goals) pertaining to such are found in the
%%% aforementioned \emph{Rules 1505-1}. Section 25, Post-Election
%%% Audit, of that document is the salient portion of that
%%% document. We will call the draft version of that document against
%%% which we originally wrote this specification
%%% \emph{RDPR-6-Jul-2017}, and the final version \emph{Rules 1505-1},
%%% for the purpose of traceability in this specification.
%%%
%%% This domain model is based upon these statutes, their associated
%%% rules, our contract with CDOS for the RLA Tool or requirements
%%% stipulated in refinement of the contract through written exchanges
%%% with CDOS, and our bibliography of publications about
%%% risk-limiting audits and digital elections. Every concept
%%% introduced herein comes from one of those sources. That full
%%% collection of resources is known as the \emph{background
%%% literature} for the system.
%%%
%%% In general, if a concept is defined, its relationship to those
%%% non-technical artifacts (statue, rules, contract, etc.) is
%%% captured using a traceability annotation of the form
%%% \begin{center}
%%% \begin{alltt}
%%% @trace <SOURCE ARTIFACT> Discussion of traceability relationship.
%%% \end{alltt}
%%% \end{center}
%%%
%%% Such annotations exist directly in the source text of this
%%% document (the file \texttt{corla.pvs} in the \texttt{spec/pvs}
%%% folder of the
%%% \href{https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/}{ColoradoRLA
%%% GitHub project}. They also will be included as margin comments
%%% with hyperlinks to the relevant target for refinement. If we are
%%% \emph{refining \textbf{from}} requirements stated in statute or
%%% rules, then we link to those higher-level documents. If we are
%%% \emph{refining \textbf{to}} implementation artifacts, then we link
%%% directly to those lower level artifacts as they exist in our
%%% source code repository.
%%%
%%% If a concept is introduced and it has no explicitly annotated
%%% traceability relation, then the reason for its introduce should be
%%% spelled out in the discussion of that concept in the same section.
%%%
%%% As discussed above, the set of all concepts defined and relevant
%%% to the system is the systems's domain model. The short definition
%%% of each and every concept is part of what constitutes the
%%% \emph{glossary} of this system. There may be other terms in the
%%% glossary introduced because they relate to, or are mentioned in,
%%% the background literature but need not be formalized to specify
%%% the RLA Tool's behavior.
%%%
%%% Currently, our glossary is a hand-written Appendix in the RLA
%%% Tool Book, found in the \texttt{docs} directory of the project
%%% repository. Before the final system delivery, that book will be
%%% integrated with this formal specification and the glossary
%%% concepts that come from this formal specification will be
%%% automatically generated out of this specification. By integrating
%%% the artifacts in this fashion we more easily guarantee precision,
%%% correctness, completeness, and traceability of our specification,
%%% both formal and informal.
%%%
%%% Another goal we have is making sure that our formal model is
%%% consistent with federal standards. In particular, the work of the
%%% NIST/EAC Interoperability Working group, Election Modeling
%%% subgroup, will likely be be useful. In that work there is a BPMN2
%%% model, pictures, XPDL, XML, and more at
%%% \href{https://github.com/usnistgov/ElectionModeling}{the NIST
%%% Election Modeling GitHub page}, and the
%%% \href{http://collaborate.nist.gov/voting/bin/view/Voting/ElectionModeling}{NIST
%%% main Election Modeling wiki}.  UML for some relevant concepts is
%%% also available via
%%% \href{https://github.com/usnistgov/CastVoteRecords}{GitHub}.  We
%%% do not have time or resources for ensuring \emph{consistency} between
%%% models now.\footnote{What consistent usually means in this context
%%% is that there is a relation we can define between types in the
%%% models that is information preserving from the simpler model to
%%% the more complex one.}
%%%
%%% \subsection{Refinement from Specification to Implementation}
%%%
%%% In order to turn a specification like this one into an
%%% implementation we must take the following steps.
%%%
%%% \begin{enumerate}
%%%
%%% \item We must decide how each type is going to be concretized into
%%% the implementation the system. Generally, modules in the
%%% formalization refine into comparable modules in the
%%% implementation. For example, a cluster of ideas that must be
%%% persisted and all relate to each other often turn into a database
%%% table or an object graph. Simpler concepts often map directly to
%%% built-in primitive and library types. Function types,
%%% unsurprisingly, turn into procedures, functions, or methods.
%%%
%%% \item We must ensure that all properties about types mandated by
%%% the specification are realized in the implementation. We use
%%% axiomatic definitions to encode types and their constraints,
%%% usually via dependent types and sometimes via literal axioms in
%%% the formal specification.
%%%
%%% A simple example will provide an example of both of these steps.
%%% The concept of risk limit is that it is a percentage. Thus, it is
%%% a number between 0 and 100. It is a modeling decision how to
%%% represent such, but given the client has not mandated that risk
%%% limits must not be fractional percentages, such as 1.25%, we must
%%% choose to use a real number to formalize the idea of risk
%%% limits. Thus, we encode the concept of risk limit as the 
%%% type
%%% \begin{center}
%%% \begin{alltt}
%%% risk_limit: TYPE = {n : nonneg_real | n <= 100}
%%% \end{alltt}
%%% \end{center}
%%% which means ``the concept of risk limit is equivalent to the set
%%% of all non-negative real numbers whose value is no greater than
%%% 100''.
%%%
%%% \item We must ensure that all properties about the system and its
%%% components are realized by the system. System properties are
%%% specified using theorems.
%%%
%%% Each theorem is refined in the system to assurance artifacts. One
%%% form of assurance is testing. Runtime verification---in the form
%%% of runtime assertion checking, automatically generated tests, or
%%% hand-written tests---can check sets of cases of each
%%% theorem. Formal verification---in the form of automatic static
%%% analysis or interactive theorem proving---can check properties
%%% wholesale in the system, ensuring that properties hold for all
%%% possible inputs in all possible environments.
%%%
%%% Given the short period of performance for this first version of
%%% the CORLA system, we are formally annotating some of the code with
%%% JML. Doing so helps us trace and think carefully about refinement
%%% from our formal specification to our implemenation. It will also
%%% permit us, after this initial burst of work is complete,
%%% automatically generate a test bench using
%%% \href{http://insttech.secretninjaformalmethods.org/software/jmlunitng/}{JMLunitNG}
%%% and automatically reason about the implementation using the
%%% \href{http://www.openjml.org/}{OpenJML tools suite}.
%%% \end{enumerate}

%%%%%% Literate PVS comments +BEGIN and +END denote blocks. A block
%%%%%% named "foo" is written to a LaTeX file "foo.tex".

%%% UOCAVA voters can return their voted ballots by email. In Colorado

%%% ballots. In some situations, say, if a voter has marked a paper

%%% original. \todosfsinger{Find sources for these, other than

%%% based on Philip Stark's online tool, \emph{Pseudo-random Number

%%% standard and has passed the most stringest testing.
%%%
%%% The SHA-256 hash function is used in ``counter mode'' to obtain the
%%% desired sample.  The sample elements are picked one by one from

%%%
%%% We will use this \texttt{randomness} module as our first and

%%% There are a few things to note about this refinement.
%%% \begin{enumerate}

%%% \item The size constraint on the type \texttt{seed} is expressed
%%% in the implementation via a precondition on its constructor,
%%% expressed both in JML and in an inline assert, and two class
%%% invariants, one which constrains seed's length and the other which

%%% because we are mapping from a PVS \texttt{nat} (natural number, a
%%% non-negative integer) to a \texttt{java.lang.String} (which
%%% encodes arbitrary unicode characters).
%%%
%%% \item A specification function, such as \texttt{rng}, is refined
%%% to a sequence of actions in the implementations. In this example,
%%% rng maps to a call to the constructor of
%%% \texttt{PseudoRandomNumberGenerator} followed by a call to
%%% \texttt{getRandomNumbers}.
%%%
%%% \item The implementation often has more functionality than is
%%% specified in the formal specification. This is normal, as the

%%% \subsection{Colorado RLAs}
%%% \label{sec:Colorado_RLAs}

%%% Audits ideally come after all the votes are tabulated, canvassed
%%% and reconciled. In Colorado, however, since the certification
%%% deadline comes shortly after the last date for voters to cure
%%% signature verification problems, etc., 
%%% it is highly unlikely that a RLA could be postponed until after
%%% the canvass.  An updated vote count may be
%%% released at the end of the tabulation and canvass, and the risk
%%% limit of the audit needs to apply to the updated outcome.
%%%
%%% Given these constraints, it is generally best to audit
%%% conservatively.  For example, we could assume that any
%%% late-tabulation ballots are cast for the losers.  As discussed in
%%% [BanuelosEtAl12], counties should add a batch of phantom ballots
%%% to the manifest, one for each possible late-tabulation ballot.
%%% Another possibility, if it turns out that not enough phantom
%%% ballots were added, would be to use more flexible Bayes audit
%%% techniques to do a followup audit after the late-tabulation
%%% ballots and tabulations are available; however, that capability is
%%% not implemented at this time.

%%% \subsection{Cast Vote Records}

%%% Cast vote records, also known as CVRs, are the digital
%%% interpretations of paper ballot records by a computer. They
%%% frequently, but not always, contain an interpretation of all voter
%%% choices in all contests on a ballot. CVRs are sometimes
%%% syntactically written as comma-separated values, and other times
%%% in plain English. Some CVRs use a election-specific encoding
%%% scheme to represent choices (e.g., a `1' means ``John Doe''); others
%%% use plain English.
%%%
%%% CVRs may (and in the case of CVRs exported from Colorado's Dominion system, do)
%%% contain information about the ballot beyond the voter choices. For 
%%% example, ballot style (which encodes, at a minimum, the set of contests on the ballot), precinct id and information about 
%%% voting method (e.g., in-person vs. mail)
%%% may be included.
%%%
%%% CDOS requirements mandate that CVRs are exported and uploaded to
%%% the RLA back-end as CSV files by county officials using their
%%% voting systems and the RLA Tool, respectively.

%%% \subsection{Authentication}

%%% CDOS has required us to use their existing two-factor

%%% thus to avoid violating our GPL license, we must design a facade
%%% for two factor authentication and not open source the adaptor that
%%% plugs that proprietary product into the facade.
%%%
%%% As such, authentication is specified at an abstract level in our
%%% system design. Consequently, we have only modeled the necessary
%%% concepts and features of any two-factor authentication
%%% system. Included in this model are the ideas of usernames,
%%% passwords, other authentication factors mentioned in CDOS
%%% documents (such as biometrics and physical tokens like smartcards
%%% and one-time authentication code books), etc.
%%%
%%% Given that CDOS is handling two-factor authentication, it is

%%% ASMs, thus transitions can depend upon not only the current state
%%% and some event, but also an arbitrary boolean expression that

%%% will be communicating with the server, as the server will be
%%% publicly accessible on the internet. We call these behaviors of
%%% the server ``exceptional behavior''. All responses to exceptional

%%% server error (\texttt{5xx}) response codes.

    NOT_FOUND_404,
    UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE_415,
    UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY_422,
    INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_500
  }
%%% The cases that we must cover are:
%%% \begin{enumerate}
%%%
%%% \item The server is simply not up and running properly. For
%%% example, if the database is not in a legal state. In these cases
%%% the server will answer with an HTTP response code of
%%% \texttt{INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR\_500}.
%%%
%%% \item In instances where the server is asked to query for a
%%% particular piece of data from the database and that does does not
%%% exist, the server will respond with a \texttt{NOT\_FOUND\_404}. This
%%% can happen, e.g., when a client uses an improper encoding for a
%%% piece of data, such as a county ID that does not exist.
%%%
%%% \item A piece of data uploaded by a client (at this point in time,
%%% either a ballot manifest, a CVR file, or an Audit CVR) is
%%% malformed and cannot be interpreted. This situation can happen,
%%% for example, if the Election Management System used to export the
%%% file has a bug, if the file is improperly edited by someone, or if
%%% there is a bug in our parser. In this situation, the server will
%%% respond with ab \texttt{UNPROCESSABLE\_ENTITY\_422} response.
%%%
%%% \item \emph{(This item is a potential future feature.)}
%%% Alternatively, if the file is of the wrong type (i.e., a PDF was
%%% uploaded when the server expected a CSV file), or if the uploaded
%%% file is too large, then the server will respond with a
%%% \texttt{UNSUPPORTED\_MEDIA\_TYPE\_415} message.
%%%
%%% \item If the client is unauthenticated, or if authentication
%%% fails, then the server will respond with a
%%% \texttt{UNAUTHORIZED\_401} response.
%%%
%%% \item If some element of a request is incorrect then the server
%%% responds with a \texttt{BAD\_REQUEST\_400} message. In particular,
%%% if the digest uploaded with a ballot manifest or a CVR file is
%%% incorrect, then the server will store the data and respond with
%%% this message.
%%%
%%% \item Finally, if the endpoint called is improper given the state
%%% that the server is in---i.e., if calling the given endpoint
%%% implies an illegal state transition---then the server will respond
%%% with a \texttt{FORBIDDEN\_403} message. This happens only when an
%%% authenticated client tried to violate the state machine of the
%%% server, and will either indicate a bug in our client code or
%%% malicious or experimental behavior on the part of some
%%% non-official party.

%+BEGIN protocol

%%% \section{Protocol}
%%% \label{sec:Protocol}
%%%
%%% As discussed in~\Cref{sec:System_Architecture},%
%%% the RLA Tool is a client-server system. In this section we
%%% describe the protocol used by the client and server to communicate
%%% with each other.

protocol: THEORY
BEGIN
  IMPORTING system_architecture,
            system_architecture_component

%%% The client-side of the system is exclusively a web browser running
%%% an HTML/Javascript-based web application.  Recall that
%%% in~\Cref{sec:System_Architecture} we mandated that all client
%%% artifacts (static content, HTML, and Javascript) are provided
%%% directly from the (web) server.

  client: VAR front_end
  browser: VAR web_browser

%%% The server-side of the system is a web server which communicates
%%% over HTTPS. It serves both static content, such as images and HTML
%%% fragments, and executable content, such as Javascript code. As
%%% such, this is a standard REST-based, multi-tier architecture.
%%%
%%% To provide assurance about system availability, we deploy multiple
%%% instances of web and application servers providing content and
%%% databases providing persistent data storage. All of these
%%% artifacts are connected over multiple networks in CDOS's hosting
%%% service. We underspecify the details of the deployment network
%%% configuration here at the request of CDOS.

  server: VAR back_end
  servers: VAR set[server]
  web_server: VAR web_server
  application_server: VAR application_server
  networks: VAR set[network]
  databases: VAR set[database]

%%% Multiple databases run in a failover configuration. Web
%%% application servers communicate with databases over a standard
%%% secure remote SQL connection. Web servers serve static content and
%%% delegate dynamic content services to the application servers.
%%%
%%% All communication between the client web browsers and the
%%% server(s) is initiated by the client, as with normal REST-based
%%% architectures. As such, functions defined in the dashboards
%%% (\Cref{sec:Dashboards}) of the system are the endpoint of all
%%% communication in the system. The RLA Tool protocol is consequently
%%% the union of all of those endpoints.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Department of State Dashboard Protocol}
%%% \label{sec:Department_of_State_Dashboard_Protocol}
%%%
%%% As discussed in~\Cref{sec:Department_of_State_Dashboard}, the
%%% Department of State Dashboard has eight (8) features: one for
%%% authentication, six for providing information about a given
%%% election and RLA, and one for getting updates on the current RLA.
%%% Each feature is encoded in a function in the
%%% \texttt{department\_of\_state\_dashboard} module.

%%% \begin{enumerate}

%%% \item \texttt{authenticate\_state\_administrator}: authentication
%%% of state administrators (the mandatory first step in the
%%% protocol),

%%% \item \texttt{select\_contests\_for\_comparison\_audit}: defining
%%% which contests will be under audit using comparison audits,

%%% \item \texttt{publish\_seed}: the publication of the random seed
%%% for RLAs in the election under audit,

%%% \item \texttt{establish\_risk\_limit\_for\_comparison\_audits}:
%%% establishments of risk limits for the election under audit,

%%% \item \texttt{public\_ballots\_to\_audit}: publishing the list of
%%% ballots to be audited for each audited contest,

%%% \item \texttt{indicate\_full\_hand\_count\_contest}: indicate that
%%% a contest must be a full hand count contest, and

%%% \item \texttt{refresh}: update the dashboard on the current state
%%% of the election and its RLAs, including the status of all
%%% counties.
%%% \end{enumerate}
%%%
%%% The first mandatory step in the protocol is authentication. All
%%% other features can be used in any order, though typically, as
%%% mandated by the C.R.S., risk limits are defined earlier than the
%%% selection of audited contests. Refreshes are automatic and
%%% periodic, the periodicity of which will be determined via UX and
%%% load testing.
%%%
%%% Each of these functions is a public feature of the system encoding
%%% what we call a ``public inbound event'' to the RLA Tool's servers.
%%% By examining one such event in detail, we will elucidate how to
%%% read and understand its specification and derive from it our
%%% network data model.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Drill-down Example of a Public Inbound Event}
%%%
%%% We will examine the function
%%% \texttt{select\_contests\_for\_comparison\_audit} in detail in
%%% this section.
%%%
%%% The first thing to note about this function is its \emph{type
%%% signature}.  The type signature tells us what types of values it
%%% depends upon (on the lefthand side of the arrow (``\texttt{->}'')
%%% and what types of values it produces (on the righthand side). The
%%% type signtuare of this function is
%%% \begin{center}
%%% \begin{alltt}
%%% [department_of_state_dashboard, set[[contest, audit_reason]] ->
%%%  [department_of_state_dashboard, set[audited_contest]]]
%%% \end{alltt}
%%% \end{center}
%%%
%%% As a consequence of the first type parameter mentioned in the
%%% signature, this function operates on the Department of State
%%% Dashboard, thus is visible to authenticated State
%%% administrators.
%%%
%%% The second parameter states that the function expects to send a
%%% \emph{set of pairs of contests and audit reasons} to the
%%% server. By virtue of the fact these two generic types (sets and
%%% pairs) are mentioned says that we must have a means by which to
%%% encode those generic notions over the network. Because we are
%%% using JSON as our general textual wire encoding format, we have a
%%% straightforward means by which to encode such.

%%% The mention of the domain-specific types \texttt{contest} and
%%% \texttt{audit\_reason} mean that we must be able to encode values
%%% of these types as well on the wire.
%%%
%%% To encode a value of a given type on the wire (and,
%%% commensurately, store a value in a database), one must be able to
%%% either or both \emph{encode its constituant values on the wire} or
%%% \emph{refer to a uniquely identified and encoded value that has
%%% been previously defined}.

%%% The type \texttt{contest} is defined as a record containing
%%% strings and choices, the latter of which ends up being encoded as
%%% a set of options which are strings.  So, in the end, a contest
%%% value's contents are nothing more than a structured assembly of
%%% strings---a straightforward thing to encode.
%%%
%%% The type \texttt{audit\_reason} is simply an \emph{enumeration},
%%% thus can be encoded in any number of ways. Commonly such
%%% structures are encoded by either string representations of the
%%% enumeration's values (such as ``\texttt{state\_wide\_contest}''
%%% and ``\texttt{county\_wide\_contest}'', for example) or by using
%%% an encoding to natural numbers (e.g., \texttt{0} means
%%% \texttt{state\_wide\_contest}, etc.). The means of encoding
%%% enumerations does not matter, so long as it is a full bijective
%%% encoding (encoding covers all values and preserves all information
%%% and is reversible). We will discuss the precise means by which we
%%% define data types and derive their JSON encodings
%%% in~\Cref{sec:wire_encoding} below.
%%%
%%% The righthand side of the function's type signature says that the
%%% dashboard will be updated after the communication with the server
%%% completes (successfully or not). If we have sufficient information
%%% about potential exceptional failure cases for the function (e.g.,
%%% we decide to deny the ability for state administrators to call
%%% this function twice to update the contests to audit more than
%%% once, we may need a response code to indicate such), then the
%%% codomain of the function must indicate such. See, for example,
%%% \texttt{county\_upload\_verified\_ballot\_manifest}.
%%%

%%% pairs.}
%%%
%%% \todokiniry{Add response code for all external public events.}
%%%
%%% \tododmz{Explan how we are doing the definition of data types and
%%% the derivation of JSON encodings.}

%%% \subsection{County Dashboard Protocol}
%%% \label{sec:County_Dashboard_Protocol}
%%%
%%% The County Dashboard has four (4) functions defined on it, all of
%%% which are public external events:
%%% \texttt{establish\_audit\_board},
%%% \texttt{county\_upload\_verified\_ballot\_manifest},
%%% \texttt{upload\_verified\_cvrs}, and
%%% \texttt{upload\_tabulation\_results}, the meaning and use of each
%%% is clear from its definition.
%%%
%%% \subsection{Audit Board Dashboard Protocol}
%%% \label{sec:Audit_Board_Dashboard_Protocol}
%%%
%%% The Audit Board Dashboard has seven (7) functions defined on it,
%%% all of which are pubic external events:
%%% \begin{enumerate}
%%% \item \texttt{ballots\_to\_audit\_to\_storage\_container\_list},
%%% which is used to help audit board members find the ballots that
%%% they must audit,
%%% \item \texttt{next\_ballot\_for\_audit}, which provides the ballot
%%% manifest information necessary to inform the audit board members
%%% of the ballot style of the pulled ballot as well as the CVR number
%%% of the ballot under audit,
%%% \item \texttt{report\_markings}, which permits the audit board
%%% members to report the markings that they see on the current paper
%%% ballot under audit,
%%% \item \texttt{report\_ballot\_not\_found}, which permits the audit
%%% board members to report that they cannot find the ballot that they
%%% are supposed to audit,
%%% \item \texttt{submit\_audit\_investigation\_report}, which permits
%%% the audit board members to submit a report of an investigation
%%% into a given discrepancy in the RLA process,
%%% \item \texttt{submit\_audit\_report}, which permits the audit
%%% board members to submit their final report on the RLA, and
%%% \item \texttt{submit\_intermediate\_audit\_report}, which permits
%%% the audit board members to submit an intermediate report on the
%%% RLA so that they can, e.g., take a break and return to the audit
%%% process later.
%%% \end{enumerate}

% @review CDOS what is the source of info presented to audit board to
% tell them which paper ballot they should examine next? Is it the CVR
% alone that is the source? And what information must the audit board
% enter into the system to ascertain that the paper ballot they are
% holding does in fact match the CVR that will be compared to their
% interpretation? Will the audit board simply click "Yes, this is the
% right paper ballot"? Or will they have to enter some confirming
% piece of information (e.g., ballot style, a ballot ID number?).

% @review CDOS if the audit has several "rounds", does the Audit Board
% need to "sign" after each round?

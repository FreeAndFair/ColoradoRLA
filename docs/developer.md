Developer Instructions
======================

This document is for developers interested in contributing to this
project. It describes the technologies used, the modules and
libraries on which we depend, and how to build the system. It also
covers how to perform quality assurance, validation, verification, and
deployment of the system. 

Determining if the system is correct includes both checking behavioral
properties and non-behavioral properties. Behavioral properties are
all about correctness and boil down to decidable (*yes or no*)
questions about the system.  Non-behavioral properties are
measurable---such as how many resources the system uses, how reliable
it is, or whether it is secure---and checking them entails ensuring
that measures are as we specify. More specifically, we cover system
performance and reliability.

Finally, the document closes with a link to our project dashboard.

Platform and Programming Languages
----------------------------------

To fulfill Coloradoâ€™s requirements, we will use a modular system
design and standard, well-understood web application technologies.

We are using a Java-based web application running on a Linux server,
hosted in the CDOS data center. We will be deploying on a JVM version
that supports Java 8. 

The choice of deployment on JVM is made due to IT constraints on the
part of CDOS. (See page 11, "Hosting Environment", of the DQ.)  While
we could have developed on .Net, and there are very good tools for
rigorous engineering on such (which we have used in, e.g., our
electronic poll book demonstrator), there are still significant
challenges in multi-platform development and deployment.  We would
rather have a straightforward cross-platform system development and
deployment story, thus we use Java 8 on the server-side.

We are using CDOS's standard SQL relational database management system
for data persistence. At this time (early July) we understand that
Informix is CDOS's preferred commercial database solution.

The user interface (UI) is browser-based. We are writing the client in
TypeScript, a mainstream, Microsoft-supported variant of JavaScript
that offers opt-in, Java-like type safety. TypeScript compiles to
plain, human-readable JavaScript, so this choice will support
client-side correctness without requiring any special web browser
support.

Developer Tools
---------------

We are using many of the following tools. Developers need not download
and install this long list of technologies. We will provide developers
a pre-configured Eclipse install, a bootstrapping Eclipse workspace,
and a VM image which can be loaded into VirtualBox or other comparable
virtualization platform. We provide these resources in order to both
decrease new developers' ramp-up time as well as to standardize on
specific versions of tools for development.

We expect to provide the initial Eclipse snapshot and workspace in the
week of 9 July 2017.

Dependencies
------------

*TBD: A concrete list of dependencies, preferably at the module/library
level, complete with versioning information. Note that we prefer that
this dependency list is automatically generated and kept up-to-date by
the build system.*

Building
--------

*TBD discussion of which build systems we use and why.*

We provide both an integrated Eclipse-based build system and a
traditional Make-based build system. The former permits us to support
a rich and interactive design, development, validation, and
verification experience in an IDE. The latter facilitates
cross-platform, IDE-independent builds and continuous integration with
Travis CI.

The Eclipse-based build system is built into our Eclipse IDE image and
our workspace. (@todo kiniry Add hyperlinks when they become available
next week.)

The Make-based system is rooted in our
top-level [Makefile](../Makefile). That build system not only compiles
the RLA tool, but also generates documentation, analyzes the system
for quality and correctness, and more.

Quality Assurance
-----------------

*TBD discussion of the various facets of quality and how these ideas
are concretized into metrics and measures that are automatically
assessed and reported upon, both within the IDE and during continuous
V&V.*

We measure quality of systems by using a variety of *dynamic* and *static*
techniques.

Dynamic analysis means that we run the system and observe it,
measuring various properties of the system and checking to see if
those measures are in the range that we expect. We say "range" because
many measures have a sweet spot---a good value is not too high and not
too low. Running the system means that we either execute the system in
a normal environment (e.g., a Java virtual machine) or we execute a
model of the system in a test environment (e.g., an instrumented
executable or a debugger).

Static analysis entails examining a system *without* executing it.
Static analysis that only examines a system's *syntactic* structure is
what we call lightweight static analysis. For example, the source
code's style and shape is syntactic.  Static analysis that examines a
system's *semantic* structure is what we call heavyweight static
analysis. For example, theorem proving with extended static checking
is heavyweight static analysis.

Each kind of static analysis results in a *measure* of a
*property*. Decidable properties are either *true* or *false*, thus a
good measure for a property is simply "yes" or "no". Other static
analyses have more interesting measures, such as grades ("A" through
"F") or a number.

In order to automatically measure the quality of a system, we define
the set of properties that we wish to measure and the what the optimal
ranges are for the measure of each property. We automate this
evalution, both in the IDE and in continuous integration. 

Also, we have a tool called the AutoGrader that automatically combines
the output of multiple analyses and "grades" the system, and
consequently its developers. By consistently seeing automated feedback
from a set of tuned static analysis tools, developers quickly learn
the development practices of a team and a project and also often learn
more about rigorous software engineering in general.

Validation and Verification
---------------------------

*TBD high level discussion here about how the goals and technologies
discussed in the V&V document are realized.*

Determining whether the system you are creating is the system that a
client wants is called *validation*.  *Testing* is one means by which
to perform validation.  Mathematically proving that a system
performs exactly as specified under an explicitly stated set of
assumptions is called *verification*.

Some of the quality assurance tools and techniques discussed above are
a part of validation and verification.

[Another document](docs/v_and_v.md) focuses on this topic in great
detail.

Deployment
----------

Free & Fair develops open source software systems in full public
view. Therefore, all artifacts associated with a given project or
product are immediately available to all stakeholders, at any time,
via a web-based collaborative development environment, such as
our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/FreeAndFair). This means
that various versions of the same system (e.g., builds for various
platforms, experimental branches in which new features are being
explored, etc.) are immediately available to anyone who browses the
project website and clicks on the right download link, or clones the
repository and builds it for themselves.

Delivery of production systems to a client or stakeholder is
accomplished by providing the modern equivalent of "golden master
disks" of yesteryear. The nature of these deliveries differs according
to decisions made during contracting and development, in tandem with
the client.

For example, if the deployment platform is a flavor of Linux, one of
the standard software packaging systems such as RPM or dpkg is used to
deliver products. If the deployment system is Microsoft Windows or Apple
OS X, the standard open source packaging software is used to deploy
production systems.

System Performance
------------------

*TBD discussion of automated performance testing*

System Reliability
------------------

*TBD discussion of automated deployment reliability testing*

To ensure business continuity, we are applying techniques we have been
developing since the 1990s to create systems for clients requiring no
more than 0.001% downtime. These techniques include practical applied
formal methods (the application of mathematical techniques to the
design, development, and assurance of software systems) and a
peer-reviewed rigorous systems engineering methodology. Our
methodology was recently recommended by a NIST internal report (IR
8151 "Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities"), presented to
the White House Office of Science and Technology at their request in
November, 2016.

Project Dashboard

notifications go, where build logs are archived, and a link to our
live dashboard.*

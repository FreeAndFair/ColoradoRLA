which involves manual interpretation of each ballot, and may involve
verifiable machine assist with checking the counts. See one suggested
procedure at
[Branscomb full hand countproposal](http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/written_comments/2017/20170718BranscombMcCarthy.pdf).

generate evidence for additional contests in a ballot-level audit. A
significant part of the effort in doing a risk-limiting audit involves
physically retrieving the ballots selected for audit.  While doing the
manual tabulation and entering the data for the contests on that ballot
which are subject to strict risk limits, it is possible to
"opportunistically" do the same thing for other contests that are observed
on the same ballot, producing evidence about them for little additional
effort.  These are called "opportunistic contests".  If an opportunistic
contest achieves a risk limit, it can be "settled", and when it appears
on subsequent ballots during the audit, it need not be tabulated.

evaluating and reporting, considerations for possible escalation, etc.

there is no corresponding Paper Ballot Card. Phantom ballots can represent
pancies between the manifest and the actual paper ballot card batches.
A manifest with a batch of purely phantom ballots can also be used
to represent the maximum number of possibly late-tabluation ballots.

* **political party** Any group of registered electors who, by petition or
assembly, nominate candidates for the official general election ballot
(Colorado Constitution, Article XXVIII Section 2).

* **post-election (historical, random) audit** Traditional post-election audits
typically entail randomly selecting a few precincts or voting machines, and checking
the associated results with a hand count of the paper ballots. While these audits do
provide some evidence that the machines have correctly interpreted voters’ intent,
they audit only a few samples, often using an artificially created subset of results,
rather than the actual election results.

things, the following: A set of commit objects. A set of references to
commit objects, called heads.

elections that gives strong evidence that the reported outcome is correct,
or reports that the evidence is not convincing.  See also *evidence-based elections*.

* **responsible bid** - A bid from a vendor that can responsibly
(i.e. is reasonably able and qualified) do the work stated in the
solicitation.

* **risk limit** - The pre-specified minimum chance of requiring a full
hand count if the outcome of a full hand count would differ from the
reported tabulation outcome.

* **risk-limiting audit (RLA)** - A procedure for manually checking a
sample of ballot (cards) (or other voter-verifiable records) that is
guaranteed to have a large, pre-specified chance of correcting the

show.) One paper describing risk-limiting audits is located at
https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/gentle12.pdf.

non-uniformly in order to target non-county-wide contests.

ending on the Operational Start Date.

intent.

a ballot scanning device, and the voter’s markings on which have been
interpreted by the voting system as valid votes, undervotes, or
overvotes.  Tabulated ballots may be duplicates of original
ballots. @review this means ballots counted by hand weren't

into election results. @review NIST Election Modeling group
separates interpretation, tally and tabulation.

reasons.

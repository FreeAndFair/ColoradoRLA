# CORLA Browser Client

## Setup

The CORLA browser client is being developed on Node v7.10.1, NPM
v4.2.0. After installing this on your platform, run `npm i` to pull in
the project build dependencies.

Most development tasks are exposed as NPM scripts. Available are:

- Run a dev server with Hot Module Reloading: `npm start`
- Build a distributable stand-alone production bundle: `npm run dist`
- Typecheck and build a development bundle (for CI): `npm run pack`
- Run unit tests: `npm test`
- Watch files and run unit tests on change: `npm run watch`
- Lint with TSLint: `npm run lint`

## Site map

Though implemented as a single-page browser application, we can use
URL paths to organize the activities provided by the application.
There are two types of users: Secretary of State officials (SSO's) and
county officials (CO's). Different users may see different pages at a
any given URL path, and have distinct site roots. We thus describe
each user type's site map separately.

Unauthenticated users will always be redirected to `/login`. If a
logged-in SOS or County user navigates to `/`, they will be redirected
to `/sos` or `/county`, as appropriate.


### Unauthenticated

#### `/login`

Authenticate as a user of either type. Should include a link to the
public audit dashboard, which is not part of the CORLA browser client.

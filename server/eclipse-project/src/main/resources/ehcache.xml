    <!-- Sets the path to the directory where cache .data files are created.
         If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by
         its value in the running VM.
         The following properties are translated:
         user.home - User's home directory
         user.dir - User's current working directory

    <!--Default Cache configuration. These will applied to caches programmatically created through
        the CacheManager.
        The following attributes are required for defaultCache:
        maxInMemory       - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
        eternal           - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the element
                            is never expired.
        timeToIdleSeconds - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal. Idle time is now - last accessed time
        timeToLiveSeconds - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal. TTL is now - creation time
        overflowToDisk    - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                            has reached the maxInMemory limit.
